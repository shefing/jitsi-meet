// FIXME The bundler-related (and the browser-related) polyfills were born at
// the very early days of prototyping the execution of lib-jitsi-meet on
// react-native. Today, the feature base/lib-jitsi-meet should not be
// responsible for such polyfills because it is not the only feature relying on
// them. Additionally, the polyfills are usually necessary earlier than the
// execution of base/lib-jitsi-meet (which is understandable given that the
// polyfills are globals). The remaining problem to be solved here is where to
// collect the polyfills' files.
